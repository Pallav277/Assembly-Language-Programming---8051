Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the 8051 microcontroller to perform a logical NAND operation for the contents stored in registers R0 and R1 and store the result in register R3


ORG 00H   ; Starting address of the program

MOV A, R0   ; Move the content of register R0 to accumulator A
ANL A, R1   ; Perform logical AND operation with the content of register R1

CPL A       ; Complement the bits in accumulator A to perform NAND operation

MOV R3, A   ; Move the result from accumulator A to register R3

END   ; End of the program
