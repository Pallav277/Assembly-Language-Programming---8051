Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the 8051 microcontroller to subtract 38h from 96h and store the result at memory location 44h


ORG 00H   ; Starting address of the program

MOV A, #96H   ; Load the first number (96h) into accumulator A
SUBB A, #38H  ; Subtract the second number (38h) from accumulator A

MOV R1, #44H  ; Load the address of memory location 44h into register R1
MOV @R1, A    ; Store the result from accumulator A into memory location 44h

END   ; End of the program
