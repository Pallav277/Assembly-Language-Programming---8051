Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the 8051 microcontroller to exchange the contents of memory locations 30h and 40h


ORG 00H   ; Starting address of the program

MOV DPTR, #30H   ; Load address of memory location 30h into DPTR
MOVX A, @DPTR    ; Move content of memory location 30h to accumulator A

MOV DPTR, #40H   ; Load address of memory location 40h into DPTR
MOVX R0, @DPTR   ; Move content of memory location 40h to register R0

MOV DPTR, #30H   ; Load address of memory location 30h into DPTR
MOVX @DPTR, R0   ; Move content of register R0 to memory location 30h

MOV DPTR, #40H   ; Load address of memory location 40h into DPTR
MOVX @DPTR, A    ; Move content of accumulator A to memory location 40h

END   ; End of the program
