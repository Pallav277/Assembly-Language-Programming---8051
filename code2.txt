Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the 8051 microcontroller to add two numbers (96h and 38h) and store the result in register R0 as well as in memory location 40h


ORG 00H   ; Starting address of the program

MOV A, #96H   ; Load the first number (96h) into accumulator A
ADD A, #38H   ; Add the second number (38h) to accumulator A

MOV R0, A     ; Move the result from accumulator A to register R0

MOV R1, #40H  ; Load the address of memory location 40h into register R1
MOV @R1, A    ; Store the result from accumulator A into memory location 40h

END   ; End of the program
