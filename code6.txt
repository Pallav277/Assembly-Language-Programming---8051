Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the 8051 microcontroller to divide the content of memory location 30h by the content of the next memory location, storing the quotient in the subsequent memory location and the remainder in the next one after that


ORG 00H   ; Starting address of the program

MOV DPTR, #30H   ; Load address of memory location 30h into DPTR
MOVX A, @DPTR    ; Move content of memory location 30h to accumulator A

INC DPTR         ; Increment DPTR to point to the next memory location
MOVX B, @DPTR    ; Move content of the next memory location to register B

DIV AB           ; Divide content of A (dividend) by content of B (divisor), result in A (quotient) and B (remainder)

INC DPTR         ; Increment DPTR to point to the next memory location
MOVX @DPTR, A    ; Store the quotient in the next memory location

INC DPTR         ; Increment DPTR to point to the next memory location
MOVX @DPTR, B    ; Store the remainder in the next memory location

END   ; End of the program
